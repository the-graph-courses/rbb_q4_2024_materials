# India Tuberculosis Treatments

The India TB Pathways dataset is based on a study conducted in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. It examines the pre-diagnostic costs and health-seeking behavior of 880 new adult pulmonary tuberculosis patients registered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs). The dataset reveals that a majority of patients initially visited private health facilities, resulting in substantial out-of-pocket (OOP) medical costs and delays prior to diagnosis and treatment initiation.

Patient visits were classified into two broad categories: 1) Public and 2) Private (PVT). Public health care facilities were further categorized in to: A) Primary Health Centres (PHCs), B) Public Referral Hospitals (PRHs)â€”including secondary and tertiary referral centres, and C) TB Sanatorium (ST), a nodal centre for TB management, situated in Tambaram, Chennai, about 120 km away from the study area.
